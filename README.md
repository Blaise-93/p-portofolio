Personal portfolio:

Blaisemart portfolio is a project I created to simply help me hold all my important works which I have created over the years as a Fullstack developer who is always eager to learn and work with team to deliver projects with deadline. I can actually work independently and do my things with little or no support, but who does not like someone to support his/her work? So, yeah, I am a team player and ready to leverage on this unending software environment to become an expert developer someday. 

My two programming languages which I do use throughout my project are Javascript and Python.
Frameworks which helps me fasten up my works which I am very good at are ReactJs, Django, FASTAPI and ExpressJS. Other vital tools I have quite used in my projects are SASS, Unittest, Jasmine Framework, Semantic UI React, Redux, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS, Figma, Git/Github, SQL (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sqlite and MariaDB) and NoSQL (like MongoDB and Firebase)


This responsive designed portfolio is written with HTML5, CSS, SCSS and JavaScript
